# Closet Organizer (WIP)

A simple wardrobe management app built with **Next.js, React, and TypeScript**.  
This is part of my preparation for the **Vinted Academy Web Engineering** application and a way to practice real-world React state management, TypeScript types, and data flow.

## Work in Progress

This project is still early.  
The core functionality is working,  
but several planned features like outfit creation, filtering, and better UI are still under development.

I am keeping the repo public to track my progress and document my growth as a developer.

## Features

- Add new clothing items through a form  
- Display all clothing items with a name and image preview  
- Delete clothing items  
- Persistent storage using localStorage  
- Global state management with React Context  
- Fully typed clothing and outfit models  

---

## Technologies

- **Next.js 14** (App Router)  
- **React** 
- **TypeScript** 
- **LocalStorage** for persistence  
- **Context API** for global state

## Notes

This is a learning focused project.  
The goal is clean code, good architecture and understanding how React state flows in a real app.
